# Security Risk Assessment & Threat Modeling Guidelines

## Purpose

This document provides a practical framework for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing technical security risks, following the NIST 800-30 standard. It is designed to guide agents through a systematic threat modeling process, ensuring consistent evaluation and effective mitigation of vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Risk Assessment Methodology

Security risks are evaluated based on two main factors:
- **Likelihood**: How probable is it that a vulnerability will be exploited?
- **Impact**: What would be the consequences if exploitation occurs?

The combination of these factors determines the overall risk severity, which informs mitigation priorities.

---

## 2. Likelihood Ratings

Assess the probability of exploitation using the following scale:

| Rating    | Description                                 | Criteria Example                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical  | Almost certain exploitation                 | Attack is almost certain to occur                     |
| High      | Easy exploitation                           | Untrained user could exploit; obvious vulnerability   |
| Medium    | Moderate exploitation difficulty            | Requires some hacking knowledge or restricted access  |
| Low       | Difficult exploitation                      | Needs significant skill, time, or resources           |
| Minimal   | Highly unlikely exploitation                | Exploitation is extremely improbable                  |

## 3. Impact Ratings

Evaluate the potential organizational consequences:

| Rating    | Description                                 | Example Effect                                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical  | Catastrophic impact                         | Severe/catastrophic effect on operations/assets       |
| High      | Severe degradation                          | Major loss of function or asset damage                |
| Medium    | Moderate degradation                        | Reduced effectiveness, possible asset damage          |
| Low       | Limited degradation                         | Noticeable but minor reduction in effectiveness       |
| Minimal   | Negligible impact                           | Little or no adverse effect                           |

## 4. Risk Calculation Matrix

Determine overall risk by cross-referencing likelihood and impact:

| Likelihood \ Impact | Minimal | Low   | Medium | High  | Critical |
|---------------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| Critical            | Minimal | Low   | Medium | High  | Critical |
| High                | Minimal | Low   | Medium | High  | Critical |
| Medium              | Minimal | Low   | Medium | Medium| High     |
| Low                 | Minimal | Low   | Low    | Low   | Medium   |
| Minimal             | Minimal | Minimal| Minimal| Low   | Low      |

---

## 5. Mitigation Guidelines

Mitigation actions are based on the calculated risk level:

| Risk Level | Action Required                | Timeline                | Decision Authority         |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Critical   | Immediate mitigation           | Schedule immediately    | Executive/Security team   |
| High       | Urgent mitigation              | As soon as possible     | Security/Project lead     |
| Medium     | Planned mitigation             | Develop timeline/accept | Project team              |
| Low        | Optional mitigation            | As resources allow      | Project team              |
| Minimal    | Accept or remediate            | As resources allow      | Project team              |

**Considerations:**  
- Resource and budget constraints  
- Business and operational priorities  
- Regulatory requirements  
- Technical feasibility  
- Organizational risk tolerance

**Step 1: Risk Identification**
- Perform code reviews, penetration tests, and vulnerability scans.
- Document vulnerabilities with technical details and affected systems.

**Step 2: Risk Assessment**
- Assign likelihood and impact ratings to each vulnerability.
- Use the risk matrix to determine overall risk severity.
- Document the rationale for each rating.

**Step 3: Risk Prioritization**
- Rank vulnerabilities by risk severity.
- Consider business context and operational needs.
- Develop a remediation roadmap.

**Step 4: Mitigation Planning**
- Create specific remediation plans.
- Assign ownership and timelines.
- Implement interim controls for high/critical risks.

**Step 5: Monitoring and Review**
- Track mitigation progress.
- Reassess risks as conditions change.
- Update assessments for new vulnerabilities.
- Periodically review and refine the methodology.

## 8. Risk Assessment Template

For each identified risk, document using this structure:

1. **Risk Description**: Explain the vulnerability and its context.
2. **Vulnerability Details**: Technical weaknesses and attack vectors.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Likelihood, impact, and calculated risk severity.
4. **Recommended Mitigation**: Specific, actionable steps.
5. **Implementation Timeline**: Phased plan with deadlines.
6. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for remediation.

### Example: 8.1. Missing Secrets Management

**Risk Description**  
During the assessment, it was found that the application does not use a secrets management solution to store sensitive information such as database credentials, encryption keys, and API keys. Instead, these secrets are stored in a configuration file (e.g., `app.properties`) that is checked into the source code repository. Some secrets were also found hardcoded in the application code. The configuration file also stores user entitlement data, granting access to the Admin Portal for users already enrolled in the organizationâ€™s access management system.

**Vulnerability Details**  
- Application secrets are stored in plaintext within configuration files and source code.
- The configuration file is version-controlled, increasing exposure risk.
- User entitlement data is managed via a static list in the configuration file.
- Internal users with access to the server or repository can escalate privileges.

**Risk Assessment**  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
  Application owners and developers with access to configuration files or source code repositories can extract secrets and bypass controls enforced by a secrets management system.
- **Impact:** High  
  Anyone with access to these secrets can gain unauthorized access to critical system components (e.g., databases, message queues, third-party APIs). Internal users could escalate privileges by modifying entitlement data.

**Recommended Mitigation**  
- Never check application secrets into source code repositories.
- Use a central key vault (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store, manage, and rotate secrets.
- Implement audit trails and regular key rotation.

**Implementation Timeline**  
- Phase 1: Design and select a secrets management solution.
- Phase 2: Refactor application to retrieve secrets from the vault.
- Phase 3: Remove secrets from codebase and configuration files.
- Phase 4: Validate and monitor the new solution.

**Success Criteria**  
- All secrets are managed by a centralized vault.
- No secrets are present in code repositories or configuration files.
- Access to secrets is logged and monitored.
- Regular rotation and review of secrets is enforced.

## 9. Report Structure Guidance

When preparing a risk assessment report, use the following structure for clarity and consistency:

1. **Risk Summary Table**  
   Begin with a table (as shown in Section 7) listing all identified threats, their likelihood, impact, risk severity, and related business risks.

2. **Detailed Risk Assessments**  
   For each threat listed in the table, provide a detailed assessment using the template in Section 8. This should include:
   - Risk Description
   - Vulnerability Details
   - Risk Assessment (Likelihood, Impact, Risk Severity)
   - Recommended Mitigation
   - Implementation Timeline
   - Success Criteria

This approach ensures that all risks are first summarized for quick reference, then thoroughly documented for actionable remediation.
